## Deep Learning Neural Network - Digits Recognition Using Keras
This project is to build a Sequential Convolutional Neural Network model for digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset using Keras API. The model has 99.6% accuracy.

### Project Goal
To correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images

### Source of dataset
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data

### Introduction
The data files train.csv and test.csv contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.

### Prerequisites
Python and Jupyter Notebook
